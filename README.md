-   GAMES

These are 3 possible games to make to practice using HTML and JS. They are listed easiest to hardest. Feel free to work on whichever one(s) are a good challenge for you. There's not much instruction -- it's up to you to decide how the site will look and the details of how it works. Be creative!


+ Coin Flip

Make a web page where you can flip a coin and it comes up heads 50% of times and tails 50% of times. Then add a box where the user can say how many coins they want to flip. Then display that many coins and flip them all randomly.

! Guess My Number

Make a web page that generates a secret random number and the user can guess the number until they get it right. For each guess, the game should display whether the answer is higher, lower, or correct.
Track how many wrong guesses the user has made so far and display that count
Track what numbers the user has already guessed and display those
Let the user choose the range of the secret number

@@ Boggle
Make a web page with Boggle
Add a timer so that each person can only take a certain amount of time for a turn
Advanced: Write a function that can solve the boggle game - find all the valid words using a dictionary
@@ text in purple (and bold)@@
```

### Pair Programming

Create a button component that takes a number property.
Make 4 instances of this button (with numbers 1-4).
The button should display the number passed in.

If you have time add styling. When a button is pressed have that button change color, when it is pressed a second time it should return to the original color.
